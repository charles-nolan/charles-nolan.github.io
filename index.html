              <p>
                We quantify the macroeconomic effects of major housing- and labour-market reforms in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.
                We estimate a small New Keynesian DSGE model with search frictions in both labour and housing markets to evaluate the collapse
                in public construction, the Right to Buy programme, the decline in trade-union bargaining power, and the shift in monetary policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We find strong cross-market spillovers: housing-market shocks account for roughly half of the volatility in unemployment and job search,
                and tight housing markets significantly dampen job creation. Counterfactual experiments imply that the observed fall in union bargaining power
                lowered the mid-1980s unemployment peak by about two percentage points relative to a no-reform path.
              </p>
              <p>
                The housing reforms tilt tenure sharply towards ownership and keep house-price-to-earnings ratios under sustained pressure, but taken together
                the reforms generate only modest changes in average affordability. In welfare terms, the negative effects of lower public construction are more than
                offset by the combination of lower unemployment and higher housing-service consumption, yielding a net welfare gain of around one percent in
                consumption-equivalent terms.

                We study how monetary and macroprudential policy should interact in a New Keynesian model with privately optimal,
                but socially risky, leverage. Entrepreneurs finance idiosyncratically risky projects under imperfect state verification,
                generating endogenous leverage, factor wedges, and an equity premium, even when aggregate risk is traded.
              </p>
              <p>
                Higher household risk aversion produces a “paradox of safety”: stronger demand for safe assets concentrates risk on
                entrepreneurial balance sheets, raising the welfare cost of cycles. Macroprudential tools act on leverage and
                balance-sheet exposures but cannot fully internalise associated externalities. A financial-stability role for monetary
                policy therefore remains—especially for temporary shocks—yet a regime that leans too hard on this role risks losing
                control of inflation.

                When government fiscal interventions are predictable, private incentives are distorted. If firms anticipate
                fiscal stimulus in a crisis, they may take on excessive risk today. How can fiscal interventions be designed
                to mitigate moral hazard, and can such interventions be time consistent?
              </p>
              <p>
                We show that stimulus programmes can be designed to induce precautionary behaviour ex ante, and we label
                these programmes prudential fiscal stimulus. We demonstrate the theory with a wage-subsidy stimulus policy.
                Countercyclical wage subsidies can be welfare-improving even in the absence of aggregate demand or labour-market
                externalities. Prudential fiscal stimulus is time inconsistent, but the presence of aggregate demand externalities
                can bring discretionary policies closer to the optimum.

                We develop a continuous-time stochastic overlapping-generations model featuring agents who face constant mortality risk
                and have constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences. The economy includes both a risk-free bond and a risky asset
                that captures systematic shocks. Unlike prior models that rely on discrete time or focus on idiosyncratic risk only, our
                approach captures aggregate stochastic dynamics under systematic risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using martingale methods, we derive closed-form expressions for individual and aggregate consumption, portfolio allocation,
                and human and financial wealth. A further contribution is a rigorous treatment of stochastic processes defined on the entire
                real line, which arise naturally in continuous-time stochastic overlapping-generations models.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an application, we analyse a small open economy subject to foreign exchange risk. Moderate exchange-rate volatility can
                raise aggregate consumption, while higher risk aversion can raise aggregate financial wealth. The model nests the classical
                Blanchard–Yaari framework as a deterministic special case and supports extensions involving stochastic income, incomplete
                markets, and the study of higher-order moments and distributions of aggregate variables.

                Can bank resolution replace ring-fencing? We develop a simple framework of expected systemic loss in which structural separability and resolvability interact. When either of two common realities holds—structure makes resolution work better, or it reduces the support needed during failure—resolution and ring-fencing become complements, not substitutes. A dual welfare/target formulation gives the same policy choice. We obtain an “inverted” comparative static: as the credibility of using resolution rises, the optimal degree of separation often increases; easing is warranted only in knife-edge cases where structure brings no marginal benefit. A private–social comparison predicts under-investment in structure and preparedness. In general, better resolvability <em>strengthens</em> the case for ring-fencing.

            Information-Sharing Protocols and Reputation in Two-Tier Fiscal Governance (with Campbell Leith)
          </div>
          <p>
            We study how two independent fiscal institutions operating at different tiers of government should coordinate information,
            assumptions, and timetables while remaining demonstrably independent, in settings where forecast errors have cash consequences
            through reconciliations and late-arriving data create timing frictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calendar sequencing and an “assumptions concordat” can reduce reconciliation volatility by improving the information set at publication,
            but may increase exposure to correlated errors when data are late. These results motivate practical design options for multi-level fiscal governance.

          <p>
            Can bank resolution replace ring-fencing? We develop a framework of expected systemic loss where design-time separability and run-time
            resolvability interact through execution efficacy and the liquidity bridge. Once either channel is active (or returns diminish), ring-fencing and resolution 
            are complements.
          </p>
          <p>
            As resolution credibility rises, the optimal ring-fence tightens; only on a knife-edge neutrality would easing be warranted. Improving resolvability
            therefore strengthens the case for structural separability.
